See project brief [here](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/week-5/project.md).

## User Story

- I want to be able to compare recent news stories from the New York Times and The Guardian.
- I would like to be able to make a direct comparison, so articles on the same topic from both news sources should be contrasted.

## Stretch Goal

- Include a search bar so the user can search news stories according to topic.
- Fronend testing

## Day One
### Morning

- Technical spike on how to use the Guardian API.
- Set up file structure, server, and install Travis as a CI tool.

### Afternoon

- Guardian API retrieves title, url, summary, and thumbnail image.
- NYT API retrieves title, url, summary, and thumbnail image.
