See project brief [here](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/week-5/project.md).

## User Story

- I want to be able to compare recent news stories from the New York Times and The Guardian.
- I would like to be able to make a direct comparison, so articles on the same topic from both news sources should be contrasted.

## Project Requirements
- [ ] Use at least 1 API
- [ ] Make your API calls from the back-end using the request module
- [ ] Your server should contain a minimum of 2 routes
- [ ] Back-end testing using tape (test as many components as you can) and basic front-end testing.
- [ ] Test your server by injecting fake HTTP requests using Shot.
- [ ] Host your project on heroku, see resources
- [ ] Use module.exports and require to break a single large server file into smaller modules.
- [ ] Consider a good server file structure based on what we have discussed over the week.
- [ ] Employ continuous integration on your project with Travis or a similar tool.
- [ ] Use CodeCov or a similar tool for test coverage.
- [ ] Display continuous integration and code coverage badges on your project README.
- [ ] Ensure that errors are handled, if for example a user attempts to make a request to a non-existent route to your server, provide the user with a custom response.

## Stretch Goal

- Include a search bar so the user can search news stories according to topic.
- Fronend testing
